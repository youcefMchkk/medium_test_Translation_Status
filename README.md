# medium problem task result

## The Task

The task is to build a basic flexdashboard that is styled using CSS - a
sidebar layout.

## the dashboard page

The dashboard page contains 2 scatter plot charts for the iris dataset,
one is for the Sepal measurements and the other is for the Petal
measurements.

## the table page

The table page displays the iris dataset, the table is linked to the
input sidebar so that we can choose the type of Species we want to select. the
logic behind the the input side bar is written in the `server` function.

## the styling

i used both the styles.css and the Rmd file for the styling. i wrote
some styling in the `ui` function for setting the height of the input
sidebar and the table. while i wrote the rest in the CSS file.
